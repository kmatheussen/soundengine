This is the sound engine from Hurtigmikser. Please
don't change API or behaviour in ways which would
break compatability with the Hurtigmikser. It would be a good
thing to let them (and possible other programs)
share the same source.

In case changes has to be made which would affect
the Hurtigmikser or other programs using this
sound engine, please send me an email.

In case you don't have time to send me an email,
at least add "if(using DSP) then" hacks as done
in SoundObject.java.
